        Hello, my name is Josh Oh. I am a software engineer with over 5 years of ASP.NET development experience.
        From front end web UI to back end database and all of the business logic in the middle, I have the experience and understanding of what it takes to keep web apps running in a live production environment.
        From collaboration, design, implementation and testing, I've had my hand in various aspects of the engineering effort.</p>
